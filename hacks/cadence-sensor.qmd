At some point during the pandemic, I became suspicious about the accuracy of my [Saris H3](https://saris.com/products/h3-direct-drive-smart-trainer) cadence sensor, so I wrote my own.

<script src="/src/lib/d3.v5.js"></script>
<script src="/src/lib/dsp.js"></script>

<button id="start">Start Cadence Sensor</button>
<div>RPM: <span id="rpm-reader"></span></div>
<div id="error-message"></div>

## How it works

The algorithm is embarrassingly simple for how well it works:

- Capture the time series of the accelerometer data (with a 1s half-life exponential decay),
- compute the PCA, and extract the first principal component. You now have a 1D time series
- Compute the FFT, and find the period with largest energy.

Smartphones: supercomputer processing power, tricorder sensors. Amazing stuff.
