The Fagan nomogram [@letter1975nomogram] is a nomogram [@enwiki:1085193589] that computes the probability
of the presence of some condition based on an imperfect test and
varying pre-test probabilities. It is a very handy tool to understand
Bayes's Theorem "physically". People typically have a sense that the
less powerful the test, the less likely it is that a
positive test result means the presence of the condition. But
people are much less likely to grasp the role of the pre-test
probability [@casscells1978interpretation].

As an illustration, consider the example illustrated in the default
setting of the nomogram below. If only 10% of the population exhibit a
particular kind of condition, then even if a test gives a ratio of
true positives to false positives at 10 to 1, only 50% of the people
tested positive will actually exhibit the condition.

Similarly, if only 10% of the population exhibits the condition, then
in order to be 90% sure that a positive result indicates the presence
of the condition, the test can give a false-positive result only
1 every 100 times it gives true positive results. Intuitively, what's
going on is that the base-10 logarithm of the "likelihood ratio" (10
and 100 respectively in the examples above) is the "number of nines
added to the baseline probability", interpreting a probability of 0.1
as having "negative 1 nine".

The original nomogram was meant to be used with a physical ruler to do
the calculations. Here, you can grab the circles and move them around
to change the settings.
