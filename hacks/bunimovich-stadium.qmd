The Bunimovich Stadium is one example of a
[Dynamical Billiards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_billiards)
table that exhibits chaotic behavior even with only concave
scatterings. Trajectories in the Bunimovich stadium exhibit (eventual)
exponential divergence over time.

In addition,
[almost any](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) trajectory
in a Bunimovich stadium eventually gets arbitrarily close to any point of the
stadium. This is in sharp contrast to trajectories in elliptical
billiards: any one trajectory in elliptical billiards will always leave
a chunk of the table unexplored.
