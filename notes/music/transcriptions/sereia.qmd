I don't understand what's going on that bolded section there. That Bbm7 into G then back to F through C sounds great, but I don't know the logic
of it. I can't make sense of any key change that might be going on there. 

In the key of F, the melody goes to a flat 3 and a flat 6 (it's not super clear if it's flat or half-flat from the singing, but the chord has a flat 6 for sure), and goes from there to G. There is no key in the diatonic scale with Bb7m and G both, so some fancy shit is going on over my head here.
