## Practice

Pachelbel's canon in D, silly but I tried and I can kind of play it!

I7, IV7, V7, and tritone substitutions for C# D# G#, ha

blues scale - easier to sing along to!

## Lesson

mr. pc - john coltrane

g phrygian dominant = c harmonic minor


paso doble

g7 -> ab7

E major -> F major ends up making a phyrigian dominant (need to add a flat B)
