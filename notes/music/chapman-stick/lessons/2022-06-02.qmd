Questions for tonight:

- How does one go about transcribing a song?

- Playing with a metronome: hard!

- Progress on:

  - Minuet in G Major, still can't really play it

  - CPE Bach's piece is progressively easier to play, I can even sometimes do a little dynamics

  - Parallel scales getting easier



- let your right hand relax

  - practice thirds on left hand
  

- raking scales pull-offs and hammer-ons, letting fingers lay down on the string rather than the tips

- arpeggios

  - 1-3-5
  - 1-3-5-7
  - 1-3-5-8

- chord based vs part based
