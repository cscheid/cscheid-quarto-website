## Questions for lesson:    

- Book still hasn't arrived..

- Intonation of strings 4-5

- 12-string stick?

- Lower melody a semi-tone?


## Things I've practiced

- learning the baritone melody neck

  - memorizing the note places (no stickers!)

  - relearning the three pieces I kind of know on baritone melody

- left-hand scales

  - still can't do them in unison, and I can't find a position for the exercise that fits the whole neck going only up and down

- sight reading on sightreadingfactory (still very hard on the stick!)

- i-iv-v with bass

If the harmonic is sharp, the string is too long
if the harmonic is flat, the string is too short
always do something with both hands, even if the practice is one of them
string transitions always 3-1 1-3
talk to yourself through it
