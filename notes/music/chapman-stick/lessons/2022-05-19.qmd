Questions for tonight:

- Where does the flat 3 come from in Big Meadows? 

  It made me think of the theme to Sneakers, which I think has a similar movement, and I also don't understand that one.

- neat thing I found in Stones's "She's a Rainbow", the song starts on the V, pretending it's in dorian.

- "so what?"

- "morning song?"

- "mr. pc john coltrane"
