B1: Rough start with fireballer right at the entrance, yikes. Found a broken Pheromone potion which I partially refilled to 25% or so.
Perk: Repulsion field over Stronger Hearts

B2: Found digging wand, Heart

B3: Learned the hard way that Chain Bolt works _terribly_ with Repulsion, making it impossible to aim.

B4: Nothing much, went into HM with quite bad wands.
HM: Had to make a call on whether to keep HM open to come back later to reassemble wands by angering the gods or just go.
Decided to anger the gods, almost died, had to repeatedly dodge Steve until I could dig my way into editing an end-game wand.
After that, I played super conservatively to heal at the Vault HM, and it was uneventful from there

- Lesson: Don't use Chain Bolt with Projectile Repulsion Field.
- Lesson: You need a lot of sustained high rate fire to kill Steve reliably
- Final Health: 245
