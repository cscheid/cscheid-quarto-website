I said "I really don't love that", and then I died.

Run was going great. Lots of hearts, wands, and all the spells we need for an endgame wand.

At the Hiisi base, I spotted an enemy picking up a wand. I literally said out loud "I really don't love that", but approached the enemy. One-shotted by a giant magic missile.
