Lots of weirdness around this run that broke my 6-win streak, including a Leggy Mimic (!!).

To make matters worse, I didn't know that Leggy Mimics drop a perk, and I accidentally picked it up. It made
the run a lot harder. Eventually I found a teleport wand, and was carefully making my way around.

I got to the Vault and I was still pretty tilted about the Leggy perk. I was getting really low on health
and didn't pay attention to a dark spot where a Thunder Mage was hiding. I got one-shot. I could maybe have survived.
if I paid more attention and had healed (since I had a healing bolt on a trigger from the previous HM).

- Lesson: don't tilt.
