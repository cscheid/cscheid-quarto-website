The seed was quite generous, with an extra Heart and Black Hole at the first biome, and Teleport
at the first HM. In B2, lots of goodies at the Fungal Caverns, including an extra heart. The
HM had an Add Mana spell, which put me in a good spot.

Snowy Depths, as usual, delivers its awfulness, and I was almost eaten by the worm there.
I barely made it to the HM, where All-Seeing Eye was the ideal perk for the Hiisi Base.

Things were going ok there, and then I was instantly dead. Never trust a Hiisi with a wand...
