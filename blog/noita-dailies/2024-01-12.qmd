This is what Noita's about.

The run had everything right from the first biome. Tinker with Wands Everywhere on the first Holy Mountain, usefully switching the first two spells for an early-game machine gun, and good spells right at the beginning: chain bolt, black hole. By the time I got to the Fungal Caverns I had 4 extra hearts and a wand that could carry me to the Jungle.

I just kept getting good spells and good wands, and so I put this wand together by the start of the Hiisi base:

![This looks innocuous, right?](2024-01-12/wand.png)

This is what it does to the game:

![Uhh, are we the baddies now?](2024-01-12/hiisi-base.webm)

![Yes, we're definitely the baddies](2024-01-12/jungle.webm)

(It's really wild that Noita lets you do this to the game.) From there, it's easy to find tons of hearts, which lets you play loose. Make chaos, _and_ beat the game? Hell yeah. I just had to:

1. watch out for polymorphine.

2. Slow down through the Temple of the Art, because [this enemy](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Hohtava_hyypi%C3%B6) will make your life miserable if you hit it with anything.

At that point all the damage+ spells stacked up to make the wand also just a fine damage dealer without the spiral shot. So I went through the Temple the simple way to get my second-ever 3-game daily streak. I'll take it!
