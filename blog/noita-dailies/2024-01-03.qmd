The first biome was, again, incredibly generous.
Yesterday we had infinite hearts. Today, all spells one could possibly want: Black Hole and Add Mana on Biome 1, as well as Energy Orb.
A trick worth noting here is that there were plenty of Fire Elementals to douse with water and
get double gold from.
The first Holy Mountain was also great: long-distance cast + teleport (trivial to traverse back to Holy Mountain), light saber, trigger.
Picked No More Shuffle at first Holy Mountain, because I was pretty confident that would lead to a good wand in the run.

On Biome 2, nothing of note, really (maybe a chainsaw in the Holy Mountain?).

In Snowy Depths, I found nothing of use (as usual). 
I saw a worm tearing through the level while I wasn't powerful enough to beat Steve, so I decided
to just run towards the Hiisi base before Steve got mad at me.

In the Holy Mountain before Hiisi base, I bought a wand that made me powerful enough to tear
through most things possibly through the Vault.

This uses Add Mana + Chainsaw in the same spell so that the [Chainsaw negates the cast delay increase](https://noita.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw) from Add Mana. It's the easiest way to cheese an infinitely-firing machine gun, and the easiest way to get a game-winning wand.

The Hiisi base was also generous in the number of healer Hiisi that were there.
Although I found no pheromone potion, there were so many healers that you could use the kicking trick:

I proceeded to find really good wands on the Hiisi base (as one does). As I was traversing back to the Holy Mountain to upgrade my machine gun, I totally ruined the run:

- Perks: No More Shuffle, Critical Hit+ (and one I don't remember?)
- Final wand: Machine gun + lightsaber all in one (would have had full sustain if I had made it back to Holy Mountain)
- Final health: 170
