On the first biome I found nothing of note except a ton of gold, and the
only good perk was Perk Lottery.

The second biome has a heart and great wands, but I made a horrible mistake, _twice_.
I forgot I had reassigned wand positions in my hotbar, and pressed the wrong one, firing a missile
in my face and cutting the exploration short. 
I didn't die right away, but it caused me to skip much of B2.

At the Snowy Depths, someone angered the gods, but I managed to kill Steve #1 by kicking the statue on his face.

At the Hiisi Base, I didn't find any good-enough wands to take down Steve, and so I died at the Holy Mountain
by failing to hit Steve again. This is a skill I need to work on.
