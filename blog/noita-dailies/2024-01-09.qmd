For the first time in ~600 hours of Noita, I died to the boss.

The run started with a sweet kick:

Through the run, I had plenty of good wands, but no actual high-damage spells that I could sustain. Eventually I found a wand full of Large Magic Missiles, and that was what I used to get through the levels. By the time I got to the Vault, I had a flask of Invisiblium (like the previous run), which I combined with some Black Holes I found, and I just dug down from there.

I had found no extra hearts, and so I really couldn't afford to go explore for better spells. I did manage to find a single Healing Bolt, which let me do the trick
where you put that spell into a wand, and then throw the wand at an enemy so it will shoot at you:

I had a funny lucky moment at the Temple of the Art, where I was hit by a blindness bolt, so I just fired a black hole down and started jumping in the dark.
It worked:

For the boss fight, I didn't realize my wand was so underpowered, and I stupidly jumped over it right as it blocked me into a pool of lava. 
I ran out of places to go:

- Final wand: Something with not nearly enough damage or speed to get through the boss's shield.
- Lesson: Projectile Repulsion Sector works _great_ with black holes for digging. It's much stronger than a single count of Repulsion Field.
