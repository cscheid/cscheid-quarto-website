Always cast Circle of Transmogrification + Repulsion, gg.

The run started well with a first biome full of goodies: Black Hole, a pretty fast damage wand, and a heart.
The Holy Mountain had Protective Shield!

My big real blunder on the run happened on B2, when I didn't notice a pile of gunpowder right over me.
Got lucky to not be buried under it:

![That should have gone worse than it did](2024-01-11/gunpowder.webm)

The Fungal Caverns had a decent wand and a Pheromone Potion.
Nothing good on Holy Mountain, picked up Living on the Edge (which I was lucky to never use).

Snowy Depths again had nothing great but an Add Mana spell on a shop outside the Holy Mountain. In the
Holy Mountain, I picked up Greed (I was short on gold, nothing else was worth it).

The Hiisi base as usual was full of good stuff. Picked up a fast non-shuffler wand which should (barely)
put me through the whole game here, as well as an extra heart and three separate heals from the Pheromone Potion.
That Holy Mountain had three fine perks: Toxic Immunity, Peace with Gods, and +1.
I picked Peace with Gods under the "minimize chaos" theory. 
I also had enough damage and life to be able to deal with the poisonous Hiisi in the Jungle, but I didn't have a machine-gun wand to fight Steve.

The Jungle was a bit of a miserable time because I had no good digging or movement spells, so it was pretty slow going.
Eventually I found a wand with Always cast Circle of Transmogrification.
I had no repulsion at this point, but this would let me at least play defense pretty well.
The Holy Mountain delivered, though. There was All-Seeing Eye there, but this was probably the 1% time that some other perk is just better, because
there was also a Projectile Repulsion Field, which makes the Always cast Circle of Transmog completely broken.

![Sheep, as far as the eye can see](2024-01-11/sheep.webm)

From there on it was smooth sailing.
The projectile repulsion field makes the single Black Hole I found into a real digging tool, so downward I went.
Made a bunch of sheep at the Temple of the Art, and picked up a Strong Teleport perk before the boss to avoid losing the way I did a few days ago.

Two in a row, not bad!

- Final wand: typical trigger + multicast + whatever
- Lesson: It seems like [this dude](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Hahmonvaihtaja) has some resistance to Circle of Transmogrification? I'm not positive and the wiki says nothing, but I could swear I shot the Circle right through him a few times and he didn't turn into a sheep.
