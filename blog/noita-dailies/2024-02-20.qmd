B1: No wands. Perks: reroll into Capacity+, spec on mediocre wand. 160HP.

B2: Lots of tricky digging I felt pretty smart doing, found chainsaw in a wand. Perk: Tinker with Wands everywhere, 185HP and almost
with a machine gun already.

B3: Don't linger here, too much damage for no real need. Run into a pheromone potion. Perk: All Seeing Eye. 195HP.

B4: Nothing great, really. 230HP. Perk: No more shuffle (spec paid off now)

B5: Realized my wand had way too much spread and that's how I died yesterday, so went back up to get the Reduce Spread spell. Less chaos, lesson learned.
Perks: Reroll 3x into stronger hearts. 250HP, 5816g

B6: Just dig. 310HP, 1546g. Perk: No more knockback.

B7: Dig.
