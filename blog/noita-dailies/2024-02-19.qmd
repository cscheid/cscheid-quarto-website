Things were going great, and at some point I had all the good spells but only shuffle wands.

I had the choice between No More Shuffle and Fire Immunity. I picked No More Shuffle, which is
almost never the right call there. It let me make an end-game wand with 2kdps right away.

... And then, in the Jungle, I got offscreen'ed by a [Master of Twitching](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/S%C3%A4tkymestari), which caused
my end-game wand to fire and insta-kill me.
