B1: Almost killed myself grabbing a heart under acid guys. HM: Drill + trigger. Perk: Skip to come back, later rerolled into levitation. 135HP, 660g

B2: Pheromone. HM: garbage trigger payloads. Perk: Extra Health over Perk lottery 145HP, 700g

B3: Worms anger the gods. Use circle of stillness. Perk: reroll into nothing pickable. 227HP, 950g

B4: Good wand. HM: nothing. Perk: reroll into exploding corpses. 287HP, 1kg

No notes for the rest, except that I had to make it all the way down with a crappy wand with no great payload and with horizontal spells
added to my main spell for enough DPS. Lots of maneuvering and jumping around, including three super steve kills with this bad wand.
