Good perks are good.

The first biome had a lot of wands. I picked up something to make a wand for biome 2. 
I also somehow ended up with about 1100 gold at the end of the biome, which is a
maybe on the 95% percentile for money there. 

Found a polymorphine flask that plays well with acid we start with: acid digs you a foothold on the Holy Mountain, then Polymorph lets you cross the tunnel without
collapsing it.) No hearts, though. The first Holy Mountain
had Electricity Immunity as the only viable perk. Because we started with 
short-range spitter bolts, I picked up a Spark Bolt with an eye towards Snowy Chasm. 

The mines had effectively nothing, but I found an Energy Orb which was my main digging tool throughout the run.
With the orb, I dug through most of the biome, picked up another ton of gold (was at 3200 or so) and found
only one heart. At 20 health, it was time to go to the Snowy Chasm. The Holy Mountain had Protective Shield,
which is a top-5 perk for me. Bought another spark bolt, a reload spell, and a teleportation spell, 
and cobbled together a wand with spark bolts spitter bolts, and multicasts.

At this point I had a passable wand for the Snowy Chasm and Hiisi base, a means of digging (orb), and a means
of getting out of trouble quick (teleport). The game now is about finding hearts. In the Chasm, I found an electricity stone,
which puts out close to a good, fun build (breathless + electricity immunity + water everywhere +
electricity). Managed to kill a worm by sheer luck with the electricity stone, too.
Later, the Holy Mountain even had the Lightning bolt spell, but the explosion damage from the spell is scary
and I had no immunity. So I bought it, stashed it, and never used it. Picked up Breathless still hoping
to get a good water run. At this point my wand was pretty good with a damage+ spell in front of
four projectile spells. 

That should be good enough for the Hiisi base, and it was. It was almost pretty smooth sailing through the base.
I found a broken wand I wanted to try to fix, and so I needed to get rid of my Polymorphine:

Later in the base I needed healing, which I got from kicking the healers:

When all was said and done, I had found two hearts, and a much faster wand. I now
had everything I needed to beat the game, and just needed to not screw up (again). The Holy Mountain
gave me Tinker With Wands Everywhere, which makes the two Ground to Sand spells I had very useful.
So my plan became to find as many hearts as possible on the jungle, and then skip most of the Vault
and Temple.

That's pretty much what I did, though I only found two hearts on the jungle. At the Holy Mountain, I found Melee Immunity.
That's a perfect perk for the jungle, but still pretty good for the Vault. At this point I added
a Heavy Shot to the wand, so I was dealing about 800dps. The Vault had nothing super interesting, but the perk was All-Seeing Eye.
That is almost exactly what you want to have for the Temple of the Art. So I just dug down with Ground-to-Sand, and
beat the boss with no real drama.
