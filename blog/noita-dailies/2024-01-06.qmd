This was a pretty impressive display of spite from Noita. 

I was exploring the first biome and I just barely saw (what in hindsight was) an exposed acid trap.
I had never seen the level generation do that, so I was pretty confused.
In the half-second it took me to recognize it, something tripped the trap. The ball of acid just expanded
across this entire area I was in, and I had nowhere to go. Instant death.

I was so shocked that I forgot to record the replay. Here's what little I got:
