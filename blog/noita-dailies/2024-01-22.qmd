The most frustrating loss so far. I _killed_ the boss, but
I had to skip Super Steve along the way because I wasn't
strong enough to get him. So I died to Super Steve as
I was waiting for the portal to the victory room.

Strange seed, where I dug through most of the Jungle and never found
anything good, only getting a boss killer wand at the beginning of the Vault.
Along the way there, I clawed my way from single-digit life totals
a couple of times. I even navigated bullet hell from Temple of the Art pretty well.
Still, not good enough.
