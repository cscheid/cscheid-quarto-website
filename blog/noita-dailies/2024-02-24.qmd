Noita, still a hard game.

B2 had everything I needed to a machine gun wand and teleport, but I never saw good digging.

I got to the Temple of the Art with 340 Health and +1 Life perk. Although my damage
was good enough for the boss, it was just barely acceptable for the temple enemies.
Without any way to quickly dig through the terrain, I wasn't good enough to
kill stuff around me and eventually got polymorphed and shot (which negates the +1 Life perk).
