This was the easiest seed all year.
The first biome had a clear heart at the beginning, and the first Holy Mountain had every spell you could hope for: Luminous Drill, Teleport, and something else (a trigger? I don't remember)

By the end of the Hiisi Base, I had an end-game machine gun wand with essentially the setup as my final wand: chainsaws, spiral shots, triggers, multicast.
I also had a 15 Black-Hole wand to dig down, easily putting me at the boss and dispatching them with no difficulty.
