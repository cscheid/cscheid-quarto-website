That sounds good\ntoo.\n\nOr we can do G A B C; root -> second -> second -> first\n\nBut then we can also do I ii V I instead, which sounds interesting as\nwell, etc etc\n\n\n## Playing with three fingers\n\nRan out of time, but I tried playing the right-hand side of Bach's\nJesus, Joy of Man's Desiring and I'm struggling in some simple\npositions. I should ask Greg about this.\n\n2022-04-20 update: I kind of figured this out; the trick is that\nwhen you learn the scales across all positions, then when the song\ndoesn't go exactly across a scale, you pick the last \"good\" finger and\ndo the next scale assuming the previous finger is in a natural position. \nYou end up moving your hands more but it totally works out.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"2022-04-11.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"99.9.9","theme":["sandstone","../../../../cscheid-net.scss"],"title":"2022-04-11","categories":["practice"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
