It is a very handy tool to understand\nBayes's Theorem \"physically\". People typically have a sense that the\nless powerful the test, the less likely it is that a\npositive test result means the presence of the condition. But\npeople are much less likely to grasp the role of the pre-test\nprobability [@casscells1978interpretation].\n\nAs an illustration, consider the example illustrated in the default\nsetting of the nomogram below. If only 10% of the population exhibit a\nparticular kind of condition, then even if a test gives a ratio of\ntrue positives to false positives at 10 to 1, only 50% of the people\ntested positive will actually exhibit the condition.\n\nSimilarly, if only 10% of the population exhibits the condition, then\nin order to be 90% sure that a positive result indicates the presence\nof the condition, the test can give a false-positive result only\n1 every 100 times it gives true positive results. Intuitively, what's\ngoing on is that the base-10 logarithm of the \"likelihood ratio\" (10\nand 100 respectively in the examples above) is the \"number of nines\nadded to the baseline probability\", interpreting a probability of 0.1\nas having \"negative 1 nine\".\n\nThe original nomogram was meant to be used with a physical ruler to do\nthe calculations. Here, you can grab the circles and move them around\nto change the settings.\n\n<div id=\"main\"></div>\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"fagan-nomogram/main.js\"></script>"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["fagan-nomogram/main.css"],"output-file":"fagan-nomogram.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"99.9.9","theme":["sandstone","../cscheid-net.scss"],"title":"An Interactive Fagan Nomogram","bibliography":["fagan-nomogram.bib"],"categories":["mathematics"],"date":"2020-11-14"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
