If you're interested in my work and that of my former students, you should also take a look at the webpage of the [HDC Lab](https://hdc.arizona.edu), which I cofounded with my colleagues, Josh Levine and Kate Isaacs.\n\n## Funded projects\n\nMy work is funded by a number of institutions, including the NSF, AT&T, and the Arizona Board of Regents.\n\n* NSF [III-1815238](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1815238): [An End-to-End Pipeline for Interactive Visual Analysis of Big Data](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/projects/end-to-end-visual-big-data/)\n* NSF [III-1513651](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1513651): [Topological Data Analysis for Large Network Visualization](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~beiwang/networktdav/networktdav.html)\n\n## Students\n\n* Katherine Best (MSc)\n* Rebecca Faust (PhD)\n* Mingwei Li (PhD)\n* Zhenge Zhao (PhD)\n* Zhe Wang (PhD)\n\n## Software projects I worked on\n\n[The year in parenthesis denotes the last year I was directly involved with the project]{.aside}\n\n* [Quarto](https://quarto.org): language-agnostic reproducible computational documents, for the web and beyond.\n* [Nanocubes](https://nanocubes.net): blazing fast large data visualization. (2013)\n* [Lux](https://github.com/cscheid/lux/): write WebGL shaders in Javascript, composably.
