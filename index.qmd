I'm a software engineer at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) working on [quarto](https://quarto.org). 

Before joining RStudio, I was an associate professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona.

## Other stuff

I like to write small JavaScript demos:

- [Explainers](explainers/)
- [Hacks](hacks/)
