I'm a software engineer at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) working on [quarto](https://quarto.org), and an associate professor on leave in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona.  Before coming to [sunny](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cscheid/16014561642/in/dateposted-public/), [beautiful](https://twitter.com/scheidegger/status/655907096991371264) [Tucson](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cscheid/16015254715/in/dateposted-public/), I worked at [AT&T Research](https://www.research.att.com) in New York.


## Software I work(ed) on

* [Quarto](https://quarto.org): language-agnostic reproducible computational documents, for the web and beyond. (2021-present)
* [Lux](https://github.com/cscheid/lux/): write WebGL shaders in Javascript, composably. (2014)
* [RCloud](https://github.com/att/rcloud): collaborative data analysis on the web (2014).
* [Nanocubes](https://nanocubes.net): blazing fast large data visualization. (2013)
* [VisTrails](https://www.vistrails.org): a provenance-aware scientific workflow system. (2009)


## Some small stuff I made

I like web browsers, and I like Javascript. (I know.)

Graphics and data visualization:

* If you take pictures of clouds from an airplane, you can see their [3D structure](http://cscheid.net/to/clouds.html).
* If you stitch together 4 hours of an intercontinental flight, you get an interesting [map of the US](https://cscheid.net/static/windowseat).
* An exploration of the [MLB Hall of Fame voting patterns](http://cscheid.net/static/mlb-hall-of-fame-voting/).

Math:

* The set of roots of polynomials with small integer coefficients has some [incredible structure](http://cscheid.github.io/lux/demos/beauty_of_roots/beauty_of_roots.html)
* The [Fagan Nomogram](https://cscheid.net/projects/fagan_nomogram/) is a great way to build intuition for Bayesâ€™s Theorem.
* The [Bunimovich stadium](https://cscheid.net/projects/bunimovich_stadium/) is a neat dynamical system.
* Some intuition for the [duality principle](https://cscheid.net/writing/data_science/duality.html) in convex optimization.
* Some intuition for how [2x2 symmetric real matrices transform vectors](https://cscheid.net/courses/fal16/cs444/lectures/lecture15/eigenvectors.html) via the eigendecomposition.

Optical illusions:

* [Purple dots](https://cscheid.net/projects/illusions/purple-dots/)
* [Ring with a rotating gap](https://cscheid.net/projects/illusions/ring-gap/)
* [Variations on the Hermann Grid](https://cscheid.net/projects/illusions/variations-on-the-hermann-grid/)
* [Straight Movement on Rotating Circle](https://cscheid.net/projects/illusions/straight-movement-on-circle/)
* [Curvature Blindness](/hacks/curvature-blindness.qmd)
* [Checkerboard and Crosses](https://cscheid.net/projects/illusions/checkerboard-crosses/)
* [Seven Circles](https://cscheid.net/projects/illusions/seven-circles/)
